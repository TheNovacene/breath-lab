# Breath Lab

Breath Lab is a small, focused nervous system dashboard built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and canvas animations.

It offers a set of guided breath patterns with soft, symbolic visuals — designed for learners, parents, and educators who need a quick way to regulate without noise, ads, or logins.
